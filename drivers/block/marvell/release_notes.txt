Changes in drv-1.7.2 (08/15/2012)
	- Fixed an issue with host buffers crossing 4GB boundary. 

Changes in drv-1.7.1 (07/13/2012)
	- Added a mechanism to ensure IO completions are processed in rare
	  cases where the completions could be missed by driver
	- Added locking mechanism for reset routines to avoid multiple
	  parallel such operations.
	- Fixed the log collecting script which could potentially cause DMA
	  hangs

Changes in drv-1.7.0 (03/30/2012)
	- Integrated wamctl and wamdiag info command implementation
	- New additional information added 'wamctl info' command output
	- Host time synchronization with firmware.
	- New 'setattr', 'getattr' commands to set/get device attributes
	- 'scap_calib schedule' option deprecated. Use setattr hchkschedule
	  option
	- 'scap_calib' supports two modes - Online and Offline mode. Offline
	  mode will ensure data is backed up before starting health check.
	- wam_info_t struct changes
		* renamed w_sc_max_vol to w_sc_exp_vol (field offset is same)
		* added new fields at the end of the structure.
	- Support for thermal alert and thermal log.
	- Bug fixes

Changes in drv-1.6.2 (01/14/2012)
	- Added a command to hard reset the device
	- Fixed an issue with running wamctl info commands from more than one
	  processes
	- Supercap Health check command will first trigger a backup and then
	  start the measurement. The DRAM state will be clean during the
	  health check and a power failure during this period will be safe.

Changes in drv-1.6.1 (12/12/2011)
	- Added dual license (MIT and GPL) header to all source files

Changes in drv-1.6.0 (11/30/2011)
	- Bumping up the version to 1.6 to be consistent with RPM versioning
	- Using 'unlocked_ioctl' instead of legacy ioctl which uses Big Kernel
	  Lock
	- Minor Performance Improvements
	- Added interrupt coalescing.
	- Added IO stats (Run 'wamdiag <dev> d' to see stats)

Changes in drv-1.2.1 (11/3/2011)
	- Fixed an issue with Supercap health measurement

Changes in drv-1.2.0 (09/28/2011)
	- Supercap health measurement display changes
	- Supercap health measurement does not stop any IOs. The measurement
	  can happen in parallel with host IOs.

Changes in drv-1.0.5 (07/13/2011)
	- Added wait_on_completion API to wait on a given IO id.

Changes in drv-1.0.4 (06/07/2011)
	- Fixed an issue in block driver. If bi_vcnt is 0, complete the IO
          and return success (returning -EINVAL results in system hang)

Changes in drv-1.0.2
	- Added basic HW compatibility check in package update

Changes in drv-1.0.1
	- Fixed an issue in update_flash in recognizing file formats

Changes in drv-1.0
	- Updated the driver version to 1.0
	- Added command to update firmware with single package file
	- Updated the installation and startup script
	- Startup script now checks for incomplete firmware update and
	  restarts the update

Changes in drv-0.25e
	- Added build_installer.sh to create an install package
	- Added Supercap Good alert to alert mechanism (alert raised when bad
	  supercap is replaced with a good one)

Changes in drv-0.25d
	- Fixed a conditional compilation issue in tools/wamlib.h

Changes in drv-0.25c
	- Fixed an issue with SSD_EOL alert. It was not being handled by driver.
	- Moved character device async IO APIs under a conditional compilation

Changes in drv-0.25b
	- Made necessary changes for event structure modification.
	- Added a command ('E') to wamdiag tool to inject errors.

Changes in drv-0.25
	- Added a shared library in user space (under tools/) providing APIs to
	control the WAM device.

Changes in drv-0.24
	- Added APIs to do IO from other kernel modules (see wamklib.h)
	- Added the ability to handle large IOs in character device
	- Restructured code to use common IO 'split' mechanism for both
	  character and block device

Changes in drv-0.23
	- Fixed a Sev 1 issue which could cause a firmware hang and pcie-reset
	during prolonged IO test.

Changes in drv-0.21
	- Fixed an issue in initiating supercap calibration if the supercap is
	already degraded.
	- Added 'wamctl' - a new CLI tool (merged eeprom update and regdump
	  diagnostic tool to wamctl tool)
	- Renamed lokitest program to 'wamdiag'

Changes in drv-0.20
	- Fixed a race condition which could cause an interrupt to be missed.

Changes in drv-0.19
	- Added Firmware reset fix
	- GET_INFO command now reports SSD SMART data like Erase Count, Bad
	  Blocks and Program Error count. To get the SMART data,
		Run: tools/lokitest <device file> I

Changes in drv-0.18
	- Added Read-only mode support during supercap calibration
	- Added Trim command support. Running trim command will also enable
	 the feature in the firmware.
		Run: tools/lokitest <device file> T

Changes in drv-0.17
	- Added support for Supercap calibration
		Run: tools/lokitest <device file> C

	- Added a generic GET_INFO command to get all the device information
		Run: tools/lokitest <device file> I

	- Added support for resetting firmware
		Run: tools/lokitest <device file> R

	- Using softirqs instead of creating kernel threads

Changes in drv-0.16
	- Fixed the queue depth issue. (The driver used to fail if number of
	  outstanding requests crossed the device queue depth)

Changes in drv-0.15
	- Added block device support. The install script will now create
	  /dev/nvdisk(0 to n-1) device files where 'n' is the number of HBAs
	  found.

Changes in drv-0.14
	- Added EEPROM update utility. 

	  Usage: tools/update_eeprom <device file> w <eeprom file>

	  Option 'w' will write the given file to the EEPROM. This roughly
	  takes about 12 seconds. It is important that the EEPROM update
	  process is not interrupted. It would otherwise make the device
	  unrecognizable by the host.

	  To read the contents of the EEPROM, 
	  Run: tools/update_eeprom <device file> r > file.bin

Changes in drv-0.13
	- Added single bit ECC error reporting. Single bit errors are logged
	  to system log.

Changes in drv-0.12
	- Fixed an issue in SSD firmware upgrade.
		Run ./tools/lokitest <device file> u <ssd firmware file>

Changes in drv-0.11
	- Added command to query if the data in dram is valid or not
		Run ./tools/lokitest <device file> q

	- Added command to get backup statistics info
		Run ./tools/lokitest <device file> g

	- Added command to list dram blocks which encountered error during
	  backup
		Run ./tools/lokitest <device file> l

	- Added command to clear backup statistics info and error blocks in
	  case of a backup error.
		Run ./tools/lokitest <device file> c

	- Added command to check the write-readiness of the device
		Run ./tools/lokitest <device file> w

	- Added command to dump device event log (the command will clear the
	  event log)
		Run ./tools/lokitest <device file> z

	(After firmware upgrade, suggest running all the above command after a
	complete powercycle)

	- Added command to display SSD firmware and serial info
		Run ./tools/lokitest <device file> t

	- Added command for SSD firmware upgrade
		Run ./tools/lokitest <device file> u
